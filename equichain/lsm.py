def check_space_group(i, soc=False, d=3):
    """ Compute LSM quantities for a given space group.

    The idea is that we work on the torus T^d, as described in Appendix G of
    [1]. The torus is acted upon by the point group G_pt = Gspace/Z^d. We first
    construct a cell decomposition of T^d that satisfies the regularity
    condition discussed in Section III.A of [1] with respect to the action of
    G_pt.

    The function returns the tuple (sp_0, sp_1, ..., sp_d), where
    sp_r is the torsion cofficients of the finite Abelian group A_r, defined as:

    * For the case where the input parameter soc = False:
        A_0 := h_0^{G_pt}(X_0, Z_2),
        where h_*^{G_pt} denotes equivariant homology, and X_r denotes the
        r-skeleton of the cell decomposition of T^d.

    * For the case where the input parameter soc = True:
        A_0 := h_{-3}^{G_pt}(X_0, Z),

    * In both cases, A_r is the image of A_0 under the map in equivariant homology induced by
        the embedding X_0 -> X_r.

    For the full details of this computed data to LSM results, see [1].
    The basic idea is that the soc=False case is relevant to spin systems
    without spin-orbit coupling, or with spin-orbit coupling and unbroken
    time-reversal symmetry, whereas the soc=True case is relevant to spin
    systems with spin-orbit coupling and broken time-reversal symmetry.

    Specifically, 
    * A_0 corresponds to the classification of anomalous textures on
    the vertices of the cell decomposition.
    * A_1 corresponds to the classification of anomalous textures, modded out by
    lattice homotopy equivalence.
    * A_r corresponds to the classification of anomalous textures, modded out by
    anomalous textures which are cancellable by an r-skeletal defect network.
